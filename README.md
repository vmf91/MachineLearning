This repo was created for a personal portfolio. Here you will find a lot of algorithms and projects related to Machine Learning. This is a collection of everything I have studied, developed and tested, including codes from books, articles and mine. Feel free to explore the codes yourselves as everything is under [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT "MIT license").
